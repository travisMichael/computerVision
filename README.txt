Instructions for running code

The following python libraries were used: numpy, cv2, and sys.

The environment for running the code uses the same anaconda environment for the previous assignments in this class

If you do not have the environment already created, then run the following command:

conda env create -f cs6475.yml

Then activate the environment by running the following command:

source activate CS6475

To run the algorithm on image set 1, run the following command:

python final_project.py island

To run the algorithm on image set 2, run the following command:

python final_project.py shower

To run the algorithm on image set 3, run the following command:

python final_project.py anne

The input and output files for each image set can be found under their associated directory names.

Here are links to the hosted image sets.
